</p>

## Backstory

~~Iâ€™ve been enamoured of the Drift screensaver ever since it came out with macOS Catalina. Itâ€™s mesmerizing. I feel like itâ€™s become an instant classic, and, dare I say, it might stand to dethrone the venerable Flurry screensaver. Hats off to the folk at Apple responsible for this gem ðŸ™Œ.~~

I also like this screensaver, but I want to just use the shaders.

>This is an attempt at capturing that magic and bottling it up in a more portable vessel. This isnâ€™t a port though. The source code for the original is locked up in a spaceship somewhere in Cupertino. Instead, consider this a delicate blend of detective work and artistic liberty.

They did a good job, but man... I'm just lazy and really want some shaders.


## Build
If you fuckin wit shader code you recognize I'm not the person to tell you this.
